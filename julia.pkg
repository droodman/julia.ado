d 'julia': package to link Stata to Julia
d
d The julia.ado package connects Stata to Julia. It provides three
d connections: 1) A "julia:" prefix command that lets
d you send single-line commands from the Stata prompt to Julia 
d and see the results. 2) Subcommands such as PutVarsToDF for 
d high-speed copying of data between Julia and Stata. 
d 3) Julia functions for reading and writing Stata variables, 
d macros, matrices, and scalars. The package requires Stata 
d version 14.1 or later and Julia 1.9 or later (free). It runs 
d in 64-bit Windows, Linux, or macOS with Apple Silicon.
