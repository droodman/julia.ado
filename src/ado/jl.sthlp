{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:jl} gives access from the Stata prompt to the free programming language Julia. It provides three
sorts of tools:

{p 4 7 0}
1. The {cmd:jl:} prefix command, which allows you to send commands to Julia and see the results. Example: {cmd:jl: 1+1}.

{p 4 7 0}
2. Subcommands, listed above, for high-speed copying of data between Julia and Stata, as well as for installation of Julia packages.

{p 4 7 0}
3. An automatically loaded library of Julia functions to allow reading and writing of Stata variables, macros, matrices, and scalars. These
functions hew closely to those in the {browse "https://www.stata.com/plugins":Stata Plugin Interface}. For example,
{cmd:jl: SF_macro_save("a", "3")} is equivalent to {cmd:global a 3}.

{pstd}
Because Julia does just-in-time-compilation, sometimes commands take longer on first use. In particular, if you have not installed
the DataFrames.jl package in Julia, {cmd:jl} will attempt to do so on first use, and that can take a minute or so.

{pstd}
The {cmd:jl:} prefix only accepts single-line expressions. But in a .do or .ado file, you can stretch that limit:{p_end}
{pmore}{inp} jl: local s = 0; for i in 1:10 s += i end; s {p_end}

{pmore}{inp} jl: {space 14}/// {p_end}
{pmore}{inp} {space 4}local s = 0; {space 1}/// {p_end}
{pmore}{inp} {space 4}for i in 1:10 /// {p_end}
{pmore}{inp} {space 8}s += i {space 3}/// {p_end}
{pmore}{inp} {space 4}end; {space 9}/// {p_end}
{pmore}{inp} {space 4}s{p_end}

{pstd}
The data-copying subcommands are low-level and high-performance. On the Stata side, they interact with
the {browse "https://www.stata.com/plugins":Stata Plugin Interface} (SPI). When copying 
from Stata to Julia, all numeric data, whether stored as {cmd:byte}, {cmd:int}, 
{cmd:long}, {cmd:float}, or {cmd:double}, is converted
to {cmd:double}--{cmd:Float64} in Julia--beacuse that is how the SPI provides the values. 

{pstd}
The subcommands whose names end with "NoMissing" are intended for data known to contain
no missing values; they are faster. How they map missing values is indeterminate. In
contrast, {cmd:PutVarsToDF} maps Stata missing values to Julia {cmd:missing}.
As a result, columns in the destination DataFrame will have type {cmd:Vector{Float64?}}, which is short for
Vector{Union{Missing, Float64}}, and is the standard type for accomodating missing values.


{marker installation}{...}
{title:Installing Julia}

{pstd}
This package is designed to work in 64-bit Windows, Linux, and MacOSX (with an Intel or Apple CPU). For it to function properly, 
Julia must be installed and the system variable JULIA_DIR must point to its location. The easiest way to assure that state
of affairs in Linux and macOS is to install Julia {browse "https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#mac-and-linux":via the installation manager juliaup}. Unfortunately, 
the easiest way to do that in Windows is to {browse "https://julialang.org/downloads/platform":install the latest version of Julia directly}--{it:not}
from the Windows Store--making sure to check the box for "Add Julia To PATH".


{title:Options}

{pstd}
{cmd:jl,} {opt qui:etly}{cmd::...} is nearly the same as {cmd:quietly jl:...}. The difference
is that the first will stop the software from copying the output of a Julia command to Stata before suppressing
that output. This will save time if the output is, say, the contents of a million-element vector.

{pstd}
In the data-copying subcommands, the {varlist}'s and {opt matname}'s before the commas always
refer to Stata variables or matrices. If a {varlist} is omitted where it is optional,
the variable list will default to {cmd:*}, i.e., all variables in the current data frame in 
their current order.

{pstd}
The options after the comma in these subcommands refer to Julia objects. {opt dest:ination()}
and {opt source()} name the Julia matrix or DataFrame to be written to or from. When
a DataFrame name is not provided, it defaults to {cmd:df}. The {opt cols()} option specifies the 
DataFrame columns to be copied to or from. It defaults to the Stata {varlist} before the comma.

{pstd}
Destination Stata matrices and Julia matrices and DataFrames are entirely replaced. Destination Stata
variables will be created with type double or, if {opt replace} is specified, overwritten, subject to any
{ifin} restriction.


{title:Stored results}

{pstd}
{cmd:jl:}, without the {opt qui:etly} option, stores the output in the macro {cmd:r(ans)}.


{title:Stata interface functions}

{pstd}
The {cmd:julia.ado} package includes, and automatically loads, a Julia module that gives access to the 
{browse "https://www.stata.com/plugins":Stata Plugin Interface}, which see for more information on 
syntax. The functions in module allow one to read and write
Stata objects from Julia. The major departure in syntax in these Julia versions is that the functions
that return data, such as an element of a Stata matrix, do so through the return value rather than a
supplied pointer to a pre-allocated storage location. For example, {cmd:jl: SF_scal_use("X")}
extracts the value of the Stata scalar {cmd:X}.
